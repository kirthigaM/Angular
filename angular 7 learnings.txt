how to deploy 
ng serve
LTS version you have to download


services has to be injected
event binding with parent and child

service more advantage than event binding

ng config schematics .@schematics/angular.component.spec false ----- not to generate the spect s file



inline style and inline template
ng g c delete/nospec -is -it

use ` in the template in angular.json

ng g c delete/componentnotinfolder/flatcomponent --flat


ng g c  delete/componentnotinfolder/flatcomponent3 --flat


below command will create only ts file

ng g c  delete/componentnotinfolder/flatcomponent4 --flat -is -it --spec false

Deployment in the  linux machine

can keep security for specific folders
